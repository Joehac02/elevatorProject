Engineering Problem #3

A company would like to begin producing residential elevators. Your team must design the control system and a prototype of an elevator that can go between three floors in any combination. The prototype must include a control panel with a set of three switches and 3 LEDâ€™s labeled to represent each floor of the elevator. A built-in safety mechanism requires that the elevator normally rest on the ground floor and return to the ground floor after a user-determined period of nonuse.
